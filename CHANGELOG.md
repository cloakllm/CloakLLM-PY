## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- PII detection engine combining spaCy NER with regex patterns (emails, SSNs, credit cards, phones, IPs, API keys, AWS keys, JWTs, IBANs)
- Deterministic tokenizer with reversible `[CATEGORY_N]` tokens
- Tamper-evident hash-chained audit logger (EU AI Act Article 12 compliance)
- Shield engine tying detection, tokenization, and audit into a single interface
- LiteLLM middleware integration (`cloakllm.enable()` / `cloakllm.disable()`)
- Multi-turn conversation support via reusable token maps
- Custom regex pattern support via `ShieldConfig.custom_patterns`
- CLI commands: `scan`, `verify`, `stats`
- CLI entry point (`cloakllm` command via `[project.scripts]`)
- Dockerfile for containerized deployment
- Test suite with 35 tests covering detection, tokenization, audit chain, and end-to-end flows

### Fixed

- Overlap detection logic missed engulfing spans (e.g. span (3,15) containing (5,10) was not detected as overlap)
- Thread ID reuse bug in LiteLLM middleware — replaced `threading.get_ident()` with per-call UUID
- `AuditLogger.log()` return type annotation now correctly returns `Optional[AuditEntry]`
- Detokenizer now handles case-insensitive token matching (LLMs may change token casing)
- Phone number validation now strips dots before checking minimum digit count
- Invalid custom regex patterns now emit a warning instead of crashing
- Removed unused `category` variable in pattern compilation loop
